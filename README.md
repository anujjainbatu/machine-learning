## Machine Learning Journey

This repository serves as a central hub for my ongoing exploration of Machine Learning (ML). It contains notebooks for my learning journey, code for practical applications, and certifications earned along the way.

### Contents

* **notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks documenting my learning process. 
    * You'll find notebooks covering various ML concepts, algorithms, and techniques.
* **code**: Python scripts implementing ML models and applications.
    * This folder holds code for practical projects and experimentation.
* **certifications**: Digital copies of my earned Machine Learning certifications (e.g., PDFs, images).

### Getting Started

This repository is primarily for personal use, but feel free to explore the notebooks and code for reference purposes.

If you'd like to run the notebooks, ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed with the necessary libraries (e.g., pandas, scikit-learn). Refer to the Jupyter documentation for installation instructions: jupyter notebook documentation: [https://jupyter.org/documentation](https://jupyter.org/documentation).

**Note:** Some notebooks might require additional dependencies specific to the project. These will be documented within the notebooks themselves.

### Contributing

Currently, this repository is not intended for external contributions. However, feel free to reach out if you have any suggestions or questions about the content.
